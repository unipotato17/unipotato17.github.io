This project is for the AP Calculus AB Final in Mrs. Burns' class. 

Topics covered are: 
- Limits with Algebraic Manipulation
- Chain Rule
- Extreme Value Theorem
- Right Riemann Sums
- Volumes of Solids (Washer Method) 

To explore all these topics, we'll be given a forensic case, in which the Mathematical Murderer is on the loose, but to catch him, you need to review all these different concepts, and answer multiple questions, which all give you clues as to the identity of the Mathematical Murderer.
