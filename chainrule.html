    <p> Welcome to your second mission: Chain Rule! Here's a brief overview of what you'll need 
      to do to complete your mission: </p>
    <h3> Chain Rule </h3> 
	  <p> The chain rule is a formula which expresses the derivative of two differentiable functions by multiplying each component of a 
      differentiable function’s derivative by the outer portions. To think about it, it’s just like a cake: you start with the first layer 
      of cake, add some frosting on the cake, and then you put on the second layer of cake, and then seal the cake with a coat of icing 
      all over it. Your first layer of cake is your inner differentiable function, and the second is the outer. <br> The notation for chain rule is most 
      often seen as <i> h'(x) = f'(g(x)) * g'(x) </i> <br> It can also be shown as dz/dx = dz/dy * dy/dx <br> Here are some example problems! We'll work
    through them with you. </p> 
    <p> 1. insert question here </p> 
	  <img src="chainrule_q1.jpg" alt="Problem #1">
         <ul>
  		<li>a) 93 </li>
  		<li>b) DNE </li>
  		<li>c) 0 </li>
		<li> d) 107 </li> 
	</ul>
<p> 2. insert question here </p> 
 <img src="chainrule_q2.jpg" alt="Problem #2">
 <ul>
  		<li> a) -5/3 </li>
  		<li>b) ∞ </li>
  		<li>c) 5/3 </li>
		<li> d) 0 </li> 
 </ul>
