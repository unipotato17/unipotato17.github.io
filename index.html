    <p> Welcome! This website was made for the final project in Mrs. Burns' AP Calculus AB Class. </p>
    
    <p> Havoc has been wreaked in Mathopolis! The Mathematical Murderer has struck again! Wait, you don't know who the Mathematical Murderer is? Let's get you up to speed. </p>
    
    <p> The Mathematical Murderer is Mathopolis' trickiest criminal, using the most complicated math problems as clues to find their identity. They've done everything you could
      ever think of: Rob Banks, Forge Checks, and of course, murder. Every time the Mathematical Murderer strikes, the citizens of Mathopolis try to solve their math problems
      to figure out their identity, but none have succeeded. It is up to you to save Mathopolis! In the next few missions, you'll learn multiple math skills, including Limits
      using Algebraic Manipulation, Chain Rule, Extreme Value Theorem, Right Riemann Sums, Antiderivatives, and The Washer Method in order to uncover the identity of the elusive 
      Mathematical Murderer! Are you up for the challenge? </p>
